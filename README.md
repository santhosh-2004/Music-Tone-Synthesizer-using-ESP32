This code creates a musical keypad system that plays different musical notes using a buzzer when you press keys on a 4x4 keypad.

It allows you to:

Play individual notes.
Record a custom tune (sequence of notes).
Replay your last tune.
Switch octaves (different pitch ranges).
Play preset songs (Jingle Bells and National anthem of India).
It also blinks an LED with every keypress and prints debug information to the serial monitor.
